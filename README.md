# Hi 👋, I'm Habib Mohammed

## Experienced Mobile App Developer

I'm a passionate Flutter developer from Ethiopia running an agency at Whales Technology. I specialize in creating robust mobile applications and regularly share knowledge through technical articles to help aspiring developers learn and grow.

Beyond development, I lead a Flutter Dev Community called Flutter Mastery, helping connect developers and share expertise. Additionally, I'm currently expanding my skills in Swift, Kotlin, and Jetpack.
